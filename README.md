(based on CRA)

The goal of this project is to see how sounds can be included in Web documents, and in interactions and UX in general.

This project will attempt doing so by recreating the Stanely Kubric Space Odyssey experience - an element that will "sing" when getting close, hinting to the user of its significance.

## Context
Sound design is a pretty much completely  ignored aspect of the web experience. Other than the big tech, almost no one is using audio ques in their apps.  
It kinda makes sense, considering the origin of the web as a collection of internet-pdf or wikipedia sites. However, in the daily experiences of the real world, and even native applications, everything comes in a full sensory experience, relying mostly on sight, yes, but usually also audio.

So I thought - if we visually animate elements when the user is interacting with them, why not also make some sounds? We can associate certain sounds with actions, teaching how to use the app faster, and giving the user more feedback and information.  

So, let's give it a try!
What did you feel in this experience?
